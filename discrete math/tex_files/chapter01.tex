\paragraph{What is a mathematical proof?} A mathematical proof is a verification of a set of propositions by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.

\paragraph{Def.} A preposition is a statement that is either true or false.\\
ex.  $2+3=5$\\
ex. $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n^2+n+41$ is a prime number
